##This is an old copdebase, the mod has been split into three parts for easier maintenance, the base mod which adds melon slabs, and two addons which add magic systems

### Lightweight vanilla+ mod for fabric.

#### Current Features:
- Melon slabs/stairs
- Pumpkin slabs/stairs
- Carved/lantern melons
- Carved/lantern melon/pumpkin slabs
- Cactus slabs

#### F.A.Q.:
- ##### Will you port it to forge?
    - I have no plans to, but if you create a forge branch, I'll accept the pull request (assuming it works).
